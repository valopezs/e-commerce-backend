## Description
This is the back end for an e-commerce site. I used Express.js API and configured it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. This application is not being deployed; therefore, I will be providing a demostration video to show the functionality of the application.

## Usage
As a manager at an internet retail company I want a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies, so that my company can compete with other e-commerce companies.
